# Installing GPG

# For Ubuntu/any Debian based distributions

# Verify GPG Installation
>gpg --version

# Generate a new key with default config
> gpg –-generate-key

# Generate a new key with your own config
> gpg –-full-generate-key

# List all GPG keys
> gpg –-list-keys

# List all GPG private keypairs
> gpg –-list-secret-keys

# Export a public key in txt file format
> gpg –-armor –-export –-output filename.txt email-id

# Encrypt a file/document (in a folder with public key)
> gpg --output encrypted-file.gpg --encrypt --recipient email-id unencrypted-file.pdf

# Decrypt the file/document using the passphrase of the encryption key
> gpg --output unencrypted-file1.pdf --decrypt encrypted-file.gpg
